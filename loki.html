			<li><a href="#">Bio</a>
				<ul>
					<strong>Loki</strong> is the adopted brother and <strong>primary antagonist of Thor.</strong>
					He's a god of mischief and trickery, known for his cunning intellect and shape-shifting abilities.
					Driven by a deep-seated desire for power and recognition, Loki often schemes to take the throne of
					Asgard,
					though his motivations are complex, stemming from feelings of <strong>abandonment and
						rivalry</strong> with his
					brother.
					Despite his villainous tendencies, Loki is a multi-faceted character, occasionally showing
					vulnerability
					and even moments of heroism, making him one of Marvel's most <strong>intriguing and unpredictable
						figures.</strong>
				</ul>
			<li><a href="#">Childhood</a>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">Bio family</a>
						<ul>
							Loki's childhood is shaped by his complex relationships with both his biological and
							adoptive families.
							Born to <strong>Laufey, the king of the Frost Giants</strong>, Loki was abandoned shortly
							after birth in a
							<strong>battle between the
								Frost Giants and Asgardians</strong>. He was discovered by Odin, king of Asgard, who
							adopted him and
							raised him alongside his biological son, Thor.
						</ul>
					<li><a href="#">Adopted family</a>
						<ul>
							Growing up in <strong>Asgard</strong>, Loki always felt like an outsider, overshadowed by
							Thor's strength and
							natural leadership. While Odin <strong>raised him as a son</strong>, Loki struggled with
							feelings of
							inadequacy and a longing for approval. His strained relationship with Thor—who was the
							favored heir to the throne—deepened his insecurities. Loki eventually discovers<strong> his
								true
								heritage as a Frost Giant</strong>, which fuels his bitterness and sense of betrayal,
							leading to his
							desire for power and recognition. His childhood, marked by these tensions, ultimately drives
							his later actions as a <strong>trickster</strong> and would-be ruler.

	<br>
	In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Loki, portrayed by Tom Hiddleston, is a complex character known for his
	wit, cunning, and charisma. He is introduced as the adopted son of Odin, the king of Asgard, and the younger
	brother of Thor. Initially, Loki struggles with his identity and sense of belonging, especially when he learns
	of his true heritage as a Frost Giant, the natural enemy of Asgardians. This revelation stirs up resentment, and
	his feelings of inadequacy fuel his ambition to claim power and prove himself, even if it means betraying his
	family.
	<br><br>
	Loki’s character arc is marked by his transformation from villain to antihero, displaying growth that is both
	gradual and compelling. In *Thor* (2011), he is motivated by envy and a desire for validation, which leads him
	to attempt to take the throne of Asgard by deceit. In *The Avengers* (2012), he becomes a formidable villain,
	trying to conquer Earth with the help of the Chitauri army and the Tesseract. However, Loki’s motivations often
	go beyond simple malice; he is deeply conflicted, driven by an insatiable need to be seen and valued.
	<br><br>
	As the MCU progresses, Loki’s evolution is brought to life through his relationship with Thor, especially in
	*Thor: Ragnarok* (2017). Here, we see Loki wrestling with his sense of family loyalty and ultimately choosing to
	fight alongside his brother to save Asgard. His journey continues in the *Loki* series on Disney+, where a
	variant version of him, called the "Loki variant," embarks on a quest for self-discovery that forces him to
	confront his past choices. This exploration of identity, redemption, and free will adds depth to his character
	and highlights Loki’s intrinsic struggle between his desire for power and his capacity for good.
